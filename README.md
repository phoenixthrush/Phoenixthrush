# <samp>About Me<samp/>

<samp>So, I've been interested in coding since 2016. It all started when a friend introduced me to this amazing Matrix-style code in Batch in 5th grade. It was just three lines of code that generated random numbers in bright green, and I was instantly hooked.</samp>

<samp>From there, I immersed myself in learning about Linux and how computers worked, and built my own PC. Then I got my hands on a Raspberry Pi and started exploring open source projects like music and NAS servers. I also rented VPS servers to host Tor relays and got into server administration.</samp>

<samp>My coding journey led me mainly to Python and web development, thanks to YouTube. Python became my everyday language, but for projects that need to be compiled I also use C when possible and some Rust.</samp>

<samp>I'm passionate about all things technical, especially cybersecurity. I try to learn something new every here and then. I'm currently learning Rust and from time to time some reverse engeering using Ghidra.</samp>

<samp>Although I used to use Gentoo for some time, I'm now an Arch user. I enjoy exploring new technologies and moving away from proprietary software. I've also gained valuable experience through multiple internships, allowing me to understand the difficulties of the IT field in day to day problems.</samp>

<samp>I'm currently studying practical computer science with a focus on Java application development and systems technology here in Germany. But I also have a passion for music and games. I especially love story-driven games like NieR Automata and Life is Strange, as well as classic titles like Tomb Raider and Resident Evil. Games with choices and consequences like Detroit Become Human are really awesome.</samp>

<samp>As for the future, I'm not quite sure what path I'm going to take. It could be software development, or maybe something completely different outside of technology.</samp>

<samp>Who knows, right?</samp>
